# Correlation Approach
## Continuous Data
To pursue correlation analysis on continuous data, we will use both `Spearman correlation` and `Pearson correlation` calculation methods to exhibit the result. However, our hypothesis is that `Pearson correlation` might portray better relationship compared to `Spearman correlation` for the following assumptions:
* data do not have outliers
* relationship is linear

## Categorical Data
For categorical data, we will be using `ANOVA` for better explanation of statistical relevance for classification tasks.
